# Ecommerce Project


# Project description/goal ü•Ö:
An ecommerce website nowadays plays a crucial role in every business model and for that reason particularly in developing web applications where PHP is considered one of the favored programming languages in this domain. As a team we will develop a web application that will allow users to register, sell or buy handmade products.

# Time Estimation‚åõ‚è≤:
